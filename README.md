# Minesweeper-Auto-Solver
MineDetecter is a aimbot for Windows XP's game called Minesweeper. The grid layout was reversed engineered. Language is C++, x86 ASM, and Win32.

# Summary
MineDetector is an application that is able to detect, analyze, and beat the game Minesweeper. I was
motivated to implement MineDetector for two reasons: I am not a good player at Minesweeper, and I
heard in Weird al Yankovic’s song White and Nerdy the following verse:

  I'm a whiz at minesweeper I can play for days
  Once you see my sweet moves you're gonna stay amazed,
  my fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze

However in MineDetector it is the mouse that is moving so fast not Weird al!

# Future Development
An additional thing that could be added is support for other versions of Minesweeper rather than the
one I developed with. This could be accomplished through byte pattern scanning to recognize the
correct places of interest. A future, but perhaps very long off future, is to upgrade MineDetector to the
new version of Minesweeper in later versions of Microsoft Windows.

Please Note
A more in-depth look into MineDetector and its development can be found in the file called
“Minesweeper AutoSolver.pdf” which can be found in the main directory.
